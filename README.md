# constitution
Made for a hackathon in February of 2015. See: http://challengepost.com/software/u-s-constitution-simulation

Simulation of the Constitution (or, at least, part of it), based on an idea Alan Kay's been throwing around for a long time.

Doesn't work too well at the moment, though: https://rsnous.com/constitution/

The architecture is also sort of interesting -- text is written in a Markdown file with interactives as React components.
